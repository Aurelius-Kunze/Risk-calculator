# Risk-calculator
A python script that calculates an attack in Risk.
I couldn't find one that calculates the chances of an attack succeeding when playing with 3 defending dice, so I made one myself.
While I was at it, I also made my program calculate how many troops are expected to survive the attack both if the attack succeeds or if the defence succeeds.
